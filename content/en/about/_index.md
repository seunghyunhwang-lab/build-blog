Any company that develops and distributes software using open source must establish an effective open source program. This is in order to reduce legal risks while creating maximum value by actively managing all open source-related activities.

* SK telecom has organized OSRB (Open Source Review Board) to collaborate with technology, legal, infrastructure, and HR teams to establish open source governance policies, build processes, and provide tools for automating them.
* SK telecom's OSPO <sub>Open Source Program Office</sub> establishes an open source strategy and provides guidelines and detailed execution plans for the proper use of open source, how to contribute to open source projects, and how to release open source.
