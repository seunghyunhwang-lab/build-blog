“SK Telecom is preparing for its transition to an AI company, and is strategically using open source to develop advanced technologies in AI, 5G, and cloud technology”, says Kim Yoon, CTO, SK Telecom. “Open source, essential for the early introduction of new technologies and rapid technological change, forms a key part of our strategy. We adopted OpenChain ISO 5230, the International Standard for open source compliance, to ensure effective process management in this space. We are also spreading our know-how around complying with open source international standards to SK affiliates and software supply chains to drive further expansion of open source ecosystems and to deliver even greater social value.”
