SONA is a solution that rebuilds the existing network based on the virtualization technology'SDN (Software Defined Networking)'. SK telecom expects that the overall function of the data center will be enhanced due to SONA, and some of the solutions have been released as open source, including in the global open source project'ONOS (Open Network Operating System)'. Through this, SONA plans to lead the creation of an open networking ecosystem at home and abroad by contributing to the open source community.
