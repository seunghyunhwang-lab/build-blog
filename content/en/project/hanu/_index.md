 ![HANU](./hanu.jpg) 

SK telecom started a new open source project, HA.NU, that can manage cloud platforms in data centers in the form of “cloud native” in the second half of 2020. Hanu means “together” and is a kind of space and community for gathering and providing various open source software (technology) related to cloud infrastructure.

The purpose of the Hanu Project is to create an ecosystem where domestic developers actively participate in Korea to develop necessary technologies together, and furthermore, it will play a role of incubating the technologies developed here. In addition to SK telecom, Korean companies such as [Open Source Consulting](https://www.osci.kr/main.php) and [XSLab](https://www.vraptor.io/) are also participating in the Hanu Project. Of these, the Special Interest Group (SIG) is also operated in cooperation with XSLab, which makes ARM-based servers. This SIG intends to newly define the server required to build a cloud infrastructure based on the ARM server led by XSLab.
